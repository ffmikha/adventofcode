Some numbers contain a digit more than once (eg 313, 111, and 144). Other numbers have digits that are all different (eg 123, 307, and 149).
Q: How many three-digit numbers are there whose digits are all different?

A: We can just count them.

1st digit: 9 choices (0 isn't an option)
2nd digit: 9 choices (any but 1st digit)
3rd digit: 8 choices (any but 1st and 2nd digits)

Should be 9 x 9 x 8 =  648 numbers with all different digits.
