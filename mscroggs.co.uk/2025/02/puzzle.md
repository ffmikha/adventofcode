Q: Eve writes down the numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive). In total she write down 11 digits.
Noel writes down the number from 1 to 100 (inclusive). How many digits does he write down?

A: 100 is the only one with 3 digits, so it becomes how many digits between 11-99 + 14
Each number between 11 and 99 has 2 digits so let's find out how many numbers there are.
11-20 has 10 numbers, so has 21-30, until 91-99 which has 9 numbers.
Then, 89 x 2 + 14 and the answer is 192.
